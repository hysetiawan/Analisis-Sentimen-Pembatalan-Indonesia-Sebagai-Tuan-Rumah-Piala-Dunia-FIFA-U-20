"I'm not confused. But that's a fact. Even though if we talk about future football events, Indonesia has already been lined up by Fifa to host the U-20 World Cup. Could be in danger of failing. Continue to use tear gas which is prohibited by Fifa, but is still used to drive away supporters. Bad already"
"Yes, the problem is that if you are sanctioned, you won't be hosting the U-20 World Cup, you won't be taking part in the Asian Cup, the problem is that it's good for political imagery in 2024. Don't worry, Mr. Sanctions is also still holding tournaments, right?"
even though Indonesia was given the opportunity to host the U-20 world cup but instead there was an unpleasant incident
"Even though the game for the Indonesian National Team is good now, I have pushed the FIFA Ranking, entered the Asian Cup and hosted the U-20 World Cup, but instead, I was banned from all competitions for 8 years, my hosting rights were revoked, everyone was dizzy plus disappointed, including. ."
But it will certainly have an impact with the cancellation of Indonesia's candidacy to become the venue for the 2023 Asian Cup and the revocation of the determination to host the U-20 World Cup in the same year
"The performance of the national team increased, two age sectors entered the Asian Cup, became the host of the U-20 World Cup.
We were proud of it, until last night's tragedy happened.
Best wishes for everyone, and condolences for all the victims of the Kanjuruhan tragedy."

"It's just a matter of time when we get banned by FIFA. And, the status of the host of the U-20 World Cup was revoked."
"As a result of last night's incident, the league was stopped, I don't know for how long because I can't expect PSSI's dilapidated performance, there is a great chance of being sanctioned by FIFA, there is a chance that the hosting rights for the U-20 World Cup will be revoked, the league has no national team performance, COOL FANATIC SUPPORT ü•∞"
"Can you imagine that the National Team Asia Cup is starting soon, next year's U-20 World Cup ""We are the Hosts"" is about to start too, it will have a lot of impact for sure"
"If because of this, Indonesia was excluded from the Asian Cup (all age categories), hosted the U-20 World Cup and was sentenced to 5 years not allowed to participate in official FIFA and ASEAN competitions (AFF). ESCAPE!!!!"
